I built additional features to the asked program, which can be activated by pressing the following keys:
    T: a trail will be added to the ball or removed from the ball
    D: draws the current Bezier curve (needs trail to be active) or stops drawing the curves
    K: keeps old Bezier curves or stops keeping old curves (needs drawing to be active)
    C: clears the window
    +: increases the ball's speed
    -: slows the ball down
    P: pauses or resumes the animation
    0: the ball's effect will be removed
    1: the ball's effect becomes lightning
    2: the ball's effect becomes bloom
    3: the ball's effect becomes gaussian blur
    4: the curve's effect will be removed
    5: the curve's effect becomes lightning
    6: the curve's effect becomes bloom
    7: the curve's effect becomes gaussian blur

The digits are not the numpad keys but the ones above the letters.
